## 🧠 About Me

I'm a dedicated and detail-oriented **backend developer** with a passion for building efficient, secure, and scalable web applications. With a strong command over **Python**, **MySQL**, and **Node.js**, I love creating systems that are both technically sound and user-centric.

I recently completed a **6-month internship at Seven Mentor, Pune**, where I worked on backend logic, API integration, and database management. This hands-on experience sharpened my understanding of real-world software development, team collaboration, and agile workflows.

I'm particularly drawn to:
- **Designing clean and modular backend architectures**
- **Automating data-driven tasks and workflows**
- **Solving algorithmic challenges and improving performance**
- **Building dashboards and data visualizations for better decision-making**

In addition to backend development, I'm also experienced in **data analysis** using tools like **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib**, helping translate raw data into actionable insights.

🎯 **Career Goal**: To contribute to innovative backend and data-driven projects while continuously growing as a developer and problem solver.
