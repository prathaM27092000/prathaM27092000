## 🧠 About Me

I'm a passionate **full-stack developer** and **data analyst** with a strong foundation in **Python**, **data structures & algorithms (DSA)**, and web technologies. During my **6-month internship at Seven Mentor, Pune**, I focused on building backend systems, solving algorithmic problems.

I have hands-on experience implementing core computer science concepts and algorithms in real-world projects. My problem-solving mindset and attention to detail drive me to write clean, efficient, and maintainable code.

🎯 **Career Goal**: To grow as a backend engineer and data analyst, contributing to scalable systems and insightful data solutions.

I'm particularly drawn to:
- **Designing clean and modular backend architectures**
- **Automating data-driven tasks and workflows**
- **Solving algorithmic challenges and improving performance**
- **Building dashboards and data visualizations for better decision-making**

In addition to backend development, I'm also experienced in **data analysis** using tools like **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib**, helping translate raw data into actionable insights.

🎯 **Career Goal**: To contribute to innovative backend and data-driven projects while continuously growing as a developer and problem solver.
